1:
Server:	Creatiing keys for - Public:  Kyber,Dillithium, RSA, ECC
			     Private: Kyber,Dillithium, RSA, ECC
Client:	Creatiing keys for - Public:  Dillithium, ECC, 
			     Private: Dillithium, ECC, AES

2. Server sends all his public keys to Client.
3. Client sends all his public keys to Server.         

4. Client sends: RSA(AES enc key) (with public RSA key from server) 			 	 	Signature with private ECC KEY (own).
5. Server verify signature with client public ECC key, and decrypt message with private RSA key. - > 	server now have AES encryption key.

6. Client uses Kyber public key (from server)  and use KEM encrypt algorithm to create ciphertext and 	shared_secret.
7. Client sign the ciphertext with dillitium private key and sends both to server.

8. Server verify message with client dillitium public key, and decrypt the message using his private 	kyber key. -> server now have kyber shared secret
9. Both sides XOR the 2 session keys (AES encryption key ^ kyber shared secret) (both keys are 32byte)
	 -> this is the new session key for aes encryption for the rest of the session.

10. Client sends messages using aes encryption with session_key and sign the message with dillituim.
11. Server verify using client public dillitium key, and decrypt using AES session_key.

12. Server reply messages using aes sesion key and sign with with dillituim.
13. Client verify using server public dillitium key, and decrypt using AES session_key.
